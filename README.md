# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. Vite is a fast build tool that offers a lightning-fast development experience, and this template provides everything you need to get started with React.

### Features:
- Fast Refresh using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for React.
- Minimal configuration for React projects.
- Built-in ESLint rules for code quality and consistency.
- Supports React 18+.

### Official Plugins:
Currently, two official plugins are available for React Fast Refresh:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh.
2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh, offering faster compilation.

  Vite Plugins for React

1. @vitejs/plugin-react
This plugin uses Babel for React Fast Refresh. It works well out-of-the-box for most use cases. The plugin includes JSX and React refresh support, so you can start building your app with minimal setup.

To use this plugin, install it via:

npm install @vitejs/plugin-react
In your vite.config.js, add the plugin configuration:

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default {
  plugins: [react()],
}
For further documentation, check the official plugin README.

2. @vitejs/plugin-react-swc
For faster compilation, you can use SWC instead of Babel. SWC is a super-fast JavaScript and TypeScript compiler written in Rust.

To use this plugin, install it via:

npm install @vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Then, in your vite.config.js, use the plugin as follows:

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

export default {
  plugins: [react()],
}
For more information on SWC, check the official SWC GitHub.

ESLint Configuration

This template comes with some basic ESLint configurations for code quality and consistency. The ESLint rules are designed to work well with modern React projects.

To get started with ESLint, make sure to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install eslint eslint-plugin-react
This configuration will help catch common JavaScript and React issues early in the development process.

You can customize the ESLint rules by editing the .eslintrc.js file in your project.

Customizing the Vite Configuration

To further customize your Vite setup, you can modify the vite.config.js file. You can:

Add additional plugins.
Modify build settings.
Enable or disable features based on your project needs.
Hereâ€™s an example of how to add a custom plugin:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
  },
})
Deployment

For deployment, Vite offers several ways to build your app for production:

Build your app:
npm run build
This will create a production-ready version of your app in the /dist directory.

Deploy to static hosting: After building, you can deploy your app to any static hosting provider like:
Vercel
Netlify
GitHub Pages
Surge
Deploy to a Node.js server: You can also deploy your app to any Node.js server using frameworks like Express or Fastify.
Conclusion

This template provides a minimal yet powerful setup to start building React apps with Vite. You can choose between Babel or SWC for fast refresh, use ESLint for code quality, and customize the build and configuration to suit your needs.
